- [ ] Tasks are organized in logical implementation phases
- [ ] No implementation details leak into task descriptions

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- [ ] Criteria use specific, quantifiable metrics where possible
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases are covered in criteria
- [ ] Performance requirements are specified where relevant
- [ ] Security considerations are included in criteria

## Completeness Check
