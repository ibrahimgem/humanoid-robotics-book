## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Students and researchers in robotics and AI
- Engineers looking to enter the field of humanoid robotics
- Developers interested in ROS 2 and robot simulation
- Anyone curious about the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds on previous concepts, so we recommend following the book in order. However, each chapter is designed to be self-contained enough that you can reference specific topics as needed.

All code examples are provided in Python (for ROS 2) and follow the IEEE citation standards for technical accuracy.

## First Example: Simple ROS 2 Node

Here's a simple ROS 2 node to illustrate the kind of code you'll encounter in this book:

```python
# Basic ROS 2 publisher example
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.i}'
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a ROS 2 node, including node creation, publisher setup, and callback functions.
