# Module 3: Simulation Environments

This module covers various simulation platforms essential for humanoid robotics development.

## Overview

Simulation is a critical component of humanoid robotics development, allowing for safe testing, algorithm development, and training before deployment on real hardware. This module explores three major simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation, Unity for high-quality rendering, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced photorealistic simulation.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up and use Gazebo for humanoid robot simulation with realistic physics
- Explore Unity as a simulation platform for humanoid robotics with high-quality rendering
- Master NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and AI training
- Understand techniques for transferring learned behaviors from simulation to real robots
